## üß† How the Credit Score Works

The score is derived from weighted factors including balance, total profit,
account age, managram history, and activity level. While this is not a financial
score in the traditional sense, it helps visualize the relative risk of lending
mana to a user.

You can review the scoring algorithm in
[`/routes/api/score.ts`](./routes/api/score.ts).

## üõ°Ô∏è Insurance Calculator

The insurance calculator uses the credit score as a baseline and adds a risk
premium. Higher risk scores lead to lower insurance costs. This is experimental
and subject to change. More info on fees: https://manifold.markets/news/risk
